# Rationale/background (using 3 to 5 scientific references)

* studies on cost efficiency of managed care plans
* little is known about the way and the possibilities of saving costs
* exploratory

# Research question(s) / objectives

> "How does saving costs in manged care plans work?"

* no hypothesis, since there is no existing knowledge to base upon

# Research design (data collection, sampling, data analysis…)

* survey:
  * pro: anonymous
  * contra:
    * no hypothesis available
    * sample too small to draw statistically conclusions
* semi-structered interviews
  * pro:
    * no in-depth knowledge of topic available
    * small number
  * contra:
    * difficult topic
    * hard to find physicians taking part, but medical networks are sometimes run by seperate administraton, which may be interested in answers as well

* unit of analysis: medical network
  * data on cost saving
  * no ethics approval needed (since unit of analysis is a network)
* only general practitioners, because they are gatekeepers
* purposeful sampling:
  * deviant cases:
    * medical networks with high savings (3) and low savings (3), respectively
  * are there differencies between those extreme groups?
  * two stage sampling:
    * 2 physicians per medical network are interviewd
* text analysis
