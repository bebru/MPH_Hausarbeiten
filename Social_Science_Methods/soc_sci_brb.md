# Introduction

Managed care plans can be seen as a reaction to market failures in health care system, like supplier-induced demand in fee-for-service reimburesement systems [@shmueli_managed_2015]. They emerged in the United States in the 1980s and 10 years later, with growing pressure due to reforms, in Europe.  
In Switzerland insurers are allowed to offer managed care plans with a limited choice of providers since 1990. Around 62% of the population were ernrolled in a restricted contract, 24% chose a plan involving a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).

The cost containing effect of managed care plans in Switzerland was shown in observational studies. @reich_empirical_2012 report differentiated results of a so called selection effect (costs are lower because health of the population in the managed care plan is better than in unrestricted plans) and an efficiency effect (the population in the managed care  plan is treated more efficiently). In contracted capitated models, where a medical network is incentiviced to meet budget constraints, 21.2% cost savings could be measuered (compared to the standard model without any restrictions).

In a most recent study, by observing people over the course of 10 years, @kauer_long-term_2016 showed that cost savings in managed care plans are both substantial and sustainable. A suspected under-provision of care according to the financial incentives, could not be observed.

However, little is known about the reasons for the measured cost containment. Evidence from empirical studies shows, that cost saving can be attributed to lower costs from specialists and medication, and a lower probability of an inpatient treatment [@trottmann_supply-side_2012].  
In their literature review, @berchtold_evidenz_2006 can find cost savings as a result of lower costs per consultation and a lower application of instrument-based medicine, as well as lower number of consultations and referrals.

Neverthelss, if observed savings are sings of efficiency gains, or the result of an under-provision of care, remains unclear [@binswanger_finanzielle_2012]. Also, in international comparison, Swiss patients visit physicians below average, and "doctor-hopping" isn't very prevalent.

The Aim of this study therefore is to shed some light on the ways managed care plans potentially lead to saving costs. To do this, it explores the decisions physicians meaningfully can take, in one or another direction, and subsequentially will lead to different costs.

# Research question

The research question of the study reads:

> "How does saving costs in manged care plans work?"

To answer this question, a physicians perspective is taken.  

In the Swiss health care system general practitioners (GP) act as first contact point. They do this informally for large parts of the population, and formally as designated gatekeepers in managed care plans.

The decisions general practitioners take therefore have a large influence on the course of treatment. But which opportunities do GPs really have? Which of them do they use regularly?

Secondary research questions are:

> "Do GPs treat patients differently according to their insurance plan?"  

> and

> "Is there any difference in the answers between GPs of medical networks with high cost savings compared to those in a network with low savings observable?"

# Research design

## Data collection

Data is collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with GPs. This method is not ideal. GPs may feel intimidated by sharing their way of working with an interviewer personally, and an anonymous survey would take account of this aspect more appropriately. Although, due to the lack of knowledge about GPs opportunities in altering the course of treatment, a survey does not seem feasible.  
The discussion in a focus group togehter with peers would possibly lead to richer results than single interviews. The chance to find enough GPs willing to talk with other GPs about how they take desicions during their work, semms very low.  
Therefore, interviews end up being to suit the situation best, giving the GPs the possibility to elaborate on their work process without strict provisions, in an environment making it possible to talk about even delicat topics which may arise.

## Sampling

The goal is to conduct interviews with 12 GPs. The sampling is done in a two stage process. First, in a purposeful sampling six medical networks are selected, which are willing to take part in the study. Second, of every of the six medical networks two GPs are interviewd seperately.  

The purposeful sampling is done to find deviant cases of medical networks. The measured efficiency effects in observational studies vary largely across different medical networks. Medical networks with high and low cost savings respectively are contacted, as long as three network of each group are found to take part in the study.  
Lists of medical networks are available in health insurances thanks to the existing contracts between insurers and networks. The cost savings of each of these networks can be derived from the also available claims data. Furthermore, the contacted networks must meet the criteria that a certain ratio of their patients must be enrolled in a managed care plan. Otherwise physicians of a network doesn't seem to be a reliable source of information about treating people in managed care plans.

## Data analysis

* text analysis
* inductive
* deviant cases

* semi-structered interviews
  * pro:
    * no in-depth knowledge of topic available
    * small number
    * inductive/deductively:
      * deductive: interview guide
      * inductive: looking for new categories
  * contra:
    * difficult topic
    * hard to find physicians taking part, but medical networks are sometimes run by seperate administraton, which may be interested in answers as well

* no ethics approval needed (since unit of analysis is a network)
