# Introduction

Managed care plans can be seen as a reaction to market failures in health care systems, e.g. supplier-induced demand in fee-for-service reimbursement systems [@shmueli_managed_2015]. They emerged in the United States in the 1980s, and 10 years later, with growing pressure due to reforms, in Europe.  
In Switzerland insurers are allowed to offer managed care plans with a limited choice of providers since 1990. Around 62% of the population were enrolled in a restricted contract in the year 2014, 24% chose a plan involving a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).

The cost containing effect of managed care plans in Switzerland was shown in observational studies. @reich_empirical_2012 report differentiated results of a so called selection effect (costs are lower because the health of the population in the managed care plan is better than in unrestricted plans) and an efficiency effect (the population in the managed care  plan is treated more efficiently). In contracted capitated models, where a medical network is incentivized to meet budget goals, 21.2% cost savings could be measured (compared to the standard model without any restrictions).

In a most recent study, by observing people over the course of 10 years, @kauer_long-term_2016 showed that cost savings in managed care plans are both substantial and sustainable. A suspected under-provision of care according to the financial incentives, could not be observed.

However, little is known about the reasons for the measured cost containment. Evidence from empirical studies shows, that cost saving can be attributed to lower costs from specialists and medication, and a lower probability of an inpatient treatment [@trottmann_supply-side_2012].  
In their literature review, @berchtold_evidenz_2006 can find cost savings as a result of lower costs per consultation and a lower application of instrument-based medicine, as well as lower number of consultations and referrals.
Nevertheless, if observed savings are signs of efficiency gains, or the result of an under-provision of care, remains unclear, not least because Swiss patients in an international comparison visit physicians below average, and "doctor-hopping" isn't very prevalent, either [@binswanger_finanzielle_2012].

The Aim of this study therefore is to shed some light on the ways managed care plans potentially lead to lower costs. To do this, it explores the decisions physicians meaningfully can take, in one or another direction, which subsequently will lead to different costs.  

This is important to know, since not every cost containing decision may be desirable, from a patient's point of view and a public health perspective. If the incentives to save costs are too strong, the risk of under-provision must be considered, which could have a negative influence on the health status of the population.

# Research question

The research question of the study reads:

> "How do general practitioners interpret their role as gatekeepers in managed care plans?"

In the Swiss health care system general practitioners (GP) usually act as first contact point. They do this informally for large parts of the population, and formally as designated gatekeepers in managed care plans. The decisions general practitioners take therefore have a large influence on the course of treatment.  

As the research question implies, the physician's perspective (general practitioners respectively) is investigated. Furthermore, the goal is to make sense of the gathered information on the basis of what managed care plans are meant for (saving costs and increasing the quality of care), and results of empirical studies on the subject (e.g. @trottmann_supply-side_2012).  

Secondary research questions are:

> "Do GPs treat patients differently according to their insurance plan?"  

> and

> "Are there consistent differences difference in the answers between GPs of medical networks with high cost savings compared to those in a network with low savings observable?"

# Research design

## Literature review

As a start, the available literature will be consulted intensively to get as much information on the topic as possible. Observational studies on the topic can be found easily in databases (e.g. PubMed).  
Since no study covering the reasons for the cost containing effect of managed care plans explicitly was found yet, the authors of the observational studies will be contacted by email to ask, if there is any unpublished work on this.

## Data collection

Data is collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with GPs. This method is not ideal. GPs may feel intimidated by sharing their way of working with an interviewer personally, and an anonymous survey would take account of this aspect more appropriately. Although, due to the lack of knowledge about GPs opportunities in altering the course of treatment, a survey does not seem feasible.  
The discussion in a focus group together with peers would possibly lead to richer results than single interviews. But the chance to find enough GPs willing to talk openly with other GPs about how they take desicions during their work, seems very low.  
Therefore, interviews suit the given situation best, giving the GPs the possibility to elaborate on their work process without strict provisions, in an environment making it possible to talk about even delicate topics which may arise.  

An interview guide will be used to make sure certain topics will be covered in every interview. The results of available studies like @trottmann_supply-side_2012 on efficiency effects in managed care plans give the direction, in which the interview guide shows. Nevertheless, enough room should be given to let the physicians talk about their strategies in working efficiently. The interviews will be recorded, so that they can be transcribed for further analysis.

## Sampling

The goal is to conduct interviews with 12 GPs in the German speaking part of Switzerland. Sampling is done in a two stage process. First, in a purposeful sampling six medical networks willing to take part in the study are selected. Second, of every of the six medical networks, two GPs are interviewed separately.  

The purposeful sampling is done to find deviant cases of medical networks. The measured efficiency effect in observational studies vary largely across different medical networks. Medical networks with high and low cost savings respectively are contacted, as long as three networks of each group are found to take part in the study.  

Lists of medical networks are available in health insurances thanks to the existing contracts between insurers and networks. The cost savings of each of these networks can be derived from the also available claims data. Furthermore, the contacted networks must meet the criteria that a certain ratio of their patients must be enrolled in a managed care plan. Otherwise, physicians of a network don't seem to be a reliable source of information about treating people in managed care plans.

## Data analysis

In the text analysis of the transcribed interviews the topics derived from available studies, already used to set up the interview guide, will give a good starting point for structuring the collected data (deductive). Further investigation of the data will bring up additional themes (inductive), leading to a typology of how GPs - in their own words - save costs in treating patients in managed care plans.

# Resources

## Time table

Figure 1 shows the time table of the study. Some tasks can be planned well in a known timespan (e.g. analyzing claims data), others will take an uncertain amount of time and overlap (e.g. contacting medical networks, organizing and conducting interviews).  
To conduct the whole study, 7 months are planned in total.

## Compensation and third-party resources

Since the claims data of a health insurer can be used for free, and all work including data collection and data analysis can be done by the researcher, no third-party resources or other compensations are needed.  
Software for analyzing the claims data is available, and an open source software will be used to analyze the transcribed text ([RQDA: R-based Qualitative Data Analysis.](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/)).

# Feasibility

Most GPs are self-employed, working with a vast amount of autonomy. A research project involving health insurances (for contacting the networks) may deter some of them. GPs may be afraid of negative consequences if they reveal insights into their working process.  
Securing the anonymity of the interviewees and the independence of the researcher is therefore inevitable in order to find medical networks and corresponding GPs taking part in the study.  

However, some medical networks form themselves from physicians with strong convictions about the necessity and meaningfulness of managed care plans (e.g. mediX). These may be more likely to take part in the study (and therefore a potential source of bias compared to more opportunistic originated networks). Additionally, some medical networks are run by a non-medical management as for-profit corporations (e.g. Medbase). Their managements may also be interested in the aim of the study, and therefore also interested in taking part.

# Ethics

Since in this study the care provider is the unit of analysis, no approval from the ethics commission is needed, as the collected data does not fall under the Human Research Act (HRA).  
Nevertheless, the collected data is sensitive, and it must not be possible to draw conclusions about the interviewees or the medical networks.  
Hence all data must be anonymized, and neither the medical networks, nor the interviewed physicians will be named in the report.

# Dissemination

The final report will be submitted to a journal in the public health/integrated care sector. Additionally, the results will be presented in the official publication of the Swiss Medical Association (FMH), the Schweizerische Ärztezeitung.  
A separate report will be written as a feedback for the medical networks taking part. This should help them to reflect their work in the team (again, without naming and blaming the interviewed physicians). If desired, the network meeting will be visited by the researcher to discuss the insights in-depth (which may act as a small incentive to collaborate in the study).
